  - interest in this project rekindled after @yuki-asano shared his YFCC data
    subset (6M files with size ~800GB) and his requirement to check if the 
    {train,val} subset of the ImageNet and Places dataset contains images 
    that are identical to his YFCC subset.
  - resuming work with some fresh new ideas

* 06-Dec-2020
  - initiated project
  - load image size quickly (without loading the full image data) using a 
    modified version of the stb_image library [https://github.com/nothings/stb]
