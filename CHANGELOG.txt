* 1.0.0 (21-June-2021)
  - find identical images (fii) in one folder or find common images in two folders
  - faster processing using two pass approach where pass 1 only compares a set 
    of 225 sparse pixel locations and pass 2 compares all pixel locations for 
    potential identical images flagged in pass 1.
  - uses multiple threads
  - export results in HTML, CSV, JSON formats
  - published identical image statistics for public images dataset
    https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/fii/
  - added self contained code to test various functionalities of fii code
  - interest in this project rekindled after @yuki-asano shared his YFCC data
    subset (6M files with size ~800GB) and his requirement to check if the 
    {train,val} subset of the ImageNet and Places dataset contains images 
    that are identical to his YFCC subset (22-May-2021).
  - resuming work with some fresh new ideas

* 0.0.1 (06-Dec-2020)
  - initiated project
  - load image size quickly (without loading the full image data) using a 
    modified version of the stb_image library [https://github.com/nothings/stb]
